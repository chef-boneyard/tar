Resources/Providers
===================

A `tar_package` LWRP provides an easy way to download remote files and compile and install them.  This only works for the most basic Autoconf programs that can do `./configure && make && make install`.

A `tar_extract` LWRP provides an easy way to download remote tar files and extract them to a local directory.

# Actions

`tar_package`
- :install: Installs the package

`tar_extract`
- :extract: Extracts the tar file

# Attribute Parameters

`tar_package`
- source: name attribute. The source remote URL.
- prefix: Directory to be used as the `--prefix` configure flag.
- source\_directory: Directory to which source files are download.
- creates: A file this command creates - if the file exists, the command will not be run.
- configure\_flags: Array of additional flags to be passed to `./configure`.

`tar_extract`
- source: name attribute. The source remote URL.
- target\_dir: Directory to extract into, e.g. tar xzf -C (target_dir)
- download\_dir: Directory to which tarball is downloaded (defaults to chef cache which requires root `group` and `user`).
- creates: A file this command creates - if the file exists, the command will not be run.
- tar\_flags: Array of additional flags to be passed to tar xzf command.
- group: Group name or group ID to extract the archive under. If set to non-root group, point to a `download_dir` the group has permission to access.
- user: User name or user ID to extract the archive under. If set to non-root user, point to a `download_dir` the user has permission to access.

# Example

    tar_package 'http://pgfoundry.org/frs/download.php/1446/pgpool-3.4.1.tar.gz' do
      prefix '/usr/local'
      creates '/usr/local/bin/pgpool'
    end

This will download, compile, and install the package from the given URL and install it into /usr/local.

    tar_extract 'http://dev.mycoderepo.com/artifacts/mycode-1.2.3.tar.gz' do
      target_dir '/opt/myapp/mycode'
      creates '/opt/myapp/mycode/lib'
      tar_flags [ '-P', '--strip-components 1' ]
    end

This will download the tarball to cache, extract the contents to /opt/myapp/mycode, use the file '/opt/myapp/mycode/bin' to determine idempotency, and pass both '-P' and '--strip-components 1' flags to the tar xzf command.
